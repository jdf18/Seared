# Main Story 

Throughout their life, XXX worked in the Company's grasp, but one thing they did not have a grasp on was XXX's will. Or the time travel technology they tried to hide from the world.

Follow XXX through the past and future. Find "humanity's" past, how they developed the present, and prevent the future the Company seeks to create.

To uncover the secrets of the past, you'll need the future to find your way, switching between the two in an immersive 2D puzzle platformer, as rich as the society before their own...


# Lore
Lore Backstory
- Inspiration from: Hollow Knight, Journey, Lone series
- Main plot: climate change and renewable energies. Dystopian future and travelling through the castle like history.
- History links. (Nuclear) Ice age. Replanting trees. The switch from wood to coal.

- Intent to sort out environmental struggle.
- Travel through their history for answers.
- Works of their own accord: stole the time travel device and is now against the Company.
- Company plans for nuclear energies to be developed. We all know how that went: Chernobyl, threat of nuclear fallout etc.
- MC wants to stop that
- Heard stories/read books on renewable energy and benefits. Can be hinted at in game but doesn't necessarily need to be there.
- Dystopian future!
- Switches between times to access the past and their "secrets". Doesn't need to be explicitly shown especially at the start but will build with lore: how the past developed into the future.
- Fix the problem, cus the Company sure won't.

- Nuclear Ice Age implied ending?

# World history

Past:
- Mundane/a little more idealised.
- Medieval style (or just an older time to fossil fuels).
- Wood primarily → slow switch to coal.
- Replant trees and use them sparingly.
- Paganism could play a part like a belief in a higher God like being(s) to look over them. Sort of like a Gaia/Terraria/God of the Earth.
- Switch to coal imaged as a gift at the beginning, but slowly turns evil. [Miasma idea, smoke, earlier deaths etc.] Probably won't be implemented cus that would be further into the story.
- Plans for further bioenergies to be produced and spread. Scrapped for an influx in coal usage. Again further into the story.

Future:
- No visible or evident renewable energy.
- Cave could show scrapped renewable energy plans alongside blueprints for other projects like transport, or main base of operations for the Company's secrets.
- No religious beliefs, no Gods, just "progress".
- Broken TV broadcasts could show these or as said blueprints laid over each other.
- Like the murals of old, just twisted for profit.
- Fossil fuels, smoke, [warm orange for sun and moon} ONLY IF NECESSARY.
- Transport influx: cars, locomotives, steam, fire, nuclear.
- Fire imagery will play a part in the "futuristic" aesthetic.
- Everything left in the dust - landfill.
- Industrial De-evolution.

# Atmosphere

Past:
- Water, Natural
- Colder colours
- Reminiscent of water
- Life clearly thriving
- Plentiful water
- Flowing river and foliage
- Lack of coal. For now.
- Horses and carts. "Primitive" transport
- Manure used for crops - natural usage
- Thriving land - greens
- Farming evident if possible
- Water dripping in cave
- All natural stones for buildings - castle
- Carvings and tapestries
- Well aired - wind effects if possible
- Clean and taken care of unlike the future. NURTURED.
- Natural light in the castle made intentionally for light to get in
- If NPCs: thriving
  
Future:
- Fire, Industrial
- Warm colours
- Hot orange for sun and moon, again only if needed
- Smoky. Embers if possible
- Dead trees → Mural of conservationalist on a dead tree
- Lack of water flow
- Dark and gloomy
- Dark looming clouds or no clouds at all
- Images of past transport: locomotives, steam engines etc. Could be in landfill and blueprints
- Dark and dusty, dry - absolutely needed for the castle and the cave
- Sort of industrial but a little more advanced
- Radioactive greens? Further into the forest/cave area.
- Torn tapestries and collapsed carvings
- Natural light due to destruction of the past
- If NPCs: depression

Devastation and contrast between past and future becomes more evident in the forest areas.
